An implementation of a Rock Paper Scissors game played against a computer written in Javascript.

The computer's move will be made by a function called computerPlay. The most optimal move, in general, is to throw a random move, which is what this function will do. When called the function will pick a random number from 1,2, or 3. Each number will be mapped to one move. 

There needs to be a gameloop function that takes the Players input and the Computer's input so that it can determine the winner. The gameloop function will call another function to determine the winner. The gameloop will count the number of rounds and the game score.

PlayerInput function that takes the input of the player (not case sensitive), and converts into the format the rest of the program is using.
